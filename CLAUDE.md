# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal repository called "tiny-backspace" that appears to be in its initial state. The repository contains only a basic README.md file with the project name.

## Current State

- This is a fresh repository with minimal content
- No package.json, build scripts, or development dependencies are present
- No source code files (.js, .ts, .py, etc.) exist yet
- No test framework or build tools are configured

## Development Commands

Currently, there are no specific build, test, or development commands available as the project has not been set up with any build tools or package managers.

## Architecture

The repository structure is minimal at this time. Future development will determine the architectural patterns and file organization.
